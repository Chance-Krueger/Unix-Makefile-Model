# Unix-Makefile-Model
C program extending mymake to mimic the Unix make utility by parsing dependency files, building a graph of targets, checking file timestamps, and rebuilding targets as needed. Supports flexible argument order with -f for makefile input and optional target specification. Handles errors, cycles, and prints executed commands.
